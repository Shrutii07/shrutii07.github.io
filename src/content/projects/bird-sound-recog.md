# Medical Image Segmentation for Cancer Detection

## Overview

Developed an advanced deep learning system for automated tumor segmentation in medical images, specifically targeting lung cancer detection in CT scans. The system assists radiologists by providing accurate tumor boundary detection and volume measurements.

## Key Features

- **High Precision**: 94% Dice coefficient on validation dataset
- **Multi-modal Support**: Works with CT, MRI, and PET scans
- **Clinical Integration**: DICOM-compliant for hospital systems
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence scores for predictions

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
- Modified U-Net with ResNet50 encoder backbone
- Attention mechanisms for improved boundary detection
- Multi-scale feature fusion for better small tumor detection
- Ensemble of 5 models for robust predictions

### Data Pipeline
- DICOM image preprocessing and normalization
- 3D volume reconstruction from 2D slices
- Advanced augmentation including elastic deformations
- Privacy-preserving federated learning approach

### Clinical Validation
- Validated on dataset of 2,500+ patient scans
- Collaboration with 3 major medical centers
- IRB approval and HIPAA compliance
- Radiologist evaluation and feedback integration

## Results

- **Segmentation Accuracy**: 94% Dice coefficient, 96% sensitivity
- **Processing Time**: 45 seconds per 3D volume
- **Clinical Agreement**: 89% agreement with expert radiologists
- **False Positive Rate**: <2% on held-out test set

## Clinical Impact

The system has been deployed in a pilot program at two hospitals, where it has processed over 500 patient scans. Radiologists report a 40% reduction in analysis time while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. The system has helped identify 12 cases that were initially missed in routine screening.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, U-Net
- **Medical Imaging**: SimpleITK, PyDICOM, Nibabel
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-image
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, VTK, 3D Slicer
- **Deployment**: Flask, Docker, NVIDIA Clara
