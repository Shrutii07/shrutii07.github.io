title: "Automated classification of cyclic alternating pattern sleep phases in healthy and sleep-disordered subjects using convolutional neural network"
description: "A deep learning model based on 1-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep phases A & B. The proposed model uses single-channel standardized electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings provided by the CAP sleep database. No manual feature extraction or pre/post processing is required making the approach completely autonomous. The model classifies CAP phases for healthy as well as for unhealthy subjects like narcolepsy, RBD, PLM, NFLE and insomnia."
