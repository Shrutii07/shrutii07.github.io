# Machine Learning Engineer - DataTech Solutions

## Role Overview

At DataTech Solutions, I focused on developing scalable machine learning systems for personalization and recommendation engines. My work involved building end-to-end ML pipelines that served millions of users while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Key Responsibilities

### ML System Development
- Designed and implemented recommendation algorithms using collaborative filtering and deep learning
- Built real-time feature engineering pipelines for personalization
- Developed A/B testing frameworks for model performance evaluation
- Optimized ML models for low-latency, high-throughput production environments

### Data Engineering & Infrastructure
- Built distributed data processing pipelines using Apache Spark
- Implemented real-time streaming systems for user behavior analysis
- Designed scalable feature stores for ML model serving
- Established monitoring and alerting systems for production ML services

### Cross-functional Collaboration
- Worked closely with product managers to define ML requirements
- Collaborated with frontend teams to integrate ML recommendations
- Partnered with data scientists on model research and experimentation
- Mentored junior engineers on ML best practices and system design

## Major Projects

### Personalization Platform
Developed a comprehensive personalization platform that increased user engagement by 25% and improved conversion rates by 18%. The system processed over 100K events per second and served personalized content to 2M+ active users.

### Real-time Recommendation Engine
Built a real-time recommendation system using deep learning models that reduced recommendation latency from 500ms to under 100ms while improving recommendation quality by 20%.

### ML Infrastructure Optimization
Led infrastructure improvements that reduced model training time by 50% and deployment time by 70% through containerization and distributed computing optimizations.

## Business Impact

- **User Engagement**: Increased user session time by 25% through better recommendations
- **Performance**: Achieved 99.9% system uptime with sub-100ms response times
- **Scalability**: Built systems handling 2M+ daily active users
- **Efficiency**: Reduced infrastructure costs by 30% through optimization
- **Team Growth**: Mentored 2 junior engineers and established ML engineering best practices
