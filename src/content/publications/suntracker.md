abstract: "This paper introduces an all-terrain robot, i.e., robot with the capability to traverse all kinds of terrain. For this purpose, the rocker-bogie mechanism was chosen for the robot design and differential gear mechanism is used to stabilize the platform. Another focus of ours in this paper is to increase the efficiency of the solar energy absorbed by the solar panels on the robot to make the robot self-powering. For this, a dual-axis sun-tracking mechanism is used. All parts of the robot were designed using CAD modeling software. The robot can be controlled via a Bluetooth joystick app of an Android phone making it extremely easy to change its speed and direction."
