title: "Bird Call Classification"
description: "This project developed an automated, multi-class classification system to advance bird conservation by accurately identifying species from remote audio recordings. We conducted a comparative study of audio embedding techniques, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Mel Spectrograms, and pre-trained models like wav2vec2, to find the most effective approach for feature extraction. The research demonstrated that an EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on Mel Spectrogram images achieved superior accuracy, effectively capturing time-frequency and contextual audio patterns. The findings also highlighted that misclassification errors frequently occur between closely related birds (e.g., within the same family), suggesting a critical need for future models to focus on distinguishing subtle vocalization differences within these groups."
