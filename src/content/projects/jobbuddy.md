title: "JobBuddy: AI-Driven Similarity Scoring for Optimal Talent Acquisition"
description: "JobBuddy is an intelligent career platform designed to optimize the hiring process through advanced machine learning. The system analyzes raw text from uploaded resumes and posted job descriptions, using BERT Tokenization to generate dense semantic embeddings. This allows the platform to move beyond keyword matching and understand the true contextual meaning of the documents. The core functionality relies on calculating the Cosine Similarity between candidate and job vectors, generating a highly accurate match score. This score powers bi-directional ranking: candidates receive personalized job recommendations, and employers are presented with the best-fit candidates for their roles. The platform is supported by a Java Spring Backend and a React/Vue.js Frontend, ensuring a fast, scalable, and user-friendly experience."
