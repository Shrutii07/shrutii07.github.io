abstract: "Sleep is an essential criterion for health. However, sleep disorders degrade the sleep quality. Hence, to diagnose sleep disorders, sleep monitoring is crucial. The cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) phases describe the sleep quality. However, CAP detection is a time-consuming, hectic, and uncertain process. Therefore, an automatic detection of CAP phases is necessary. This study proposes a hierarchical approach to identify sleep disorders and classify CAP phases. Single-channel EEG recording provided by the CAP sleep database has been utilized in this study. The proposed approach classifies CAP sequence into healthy or unhealthy. Further, it identifies sleep disorder of unhealthy sequence among periodic leg movement (PLM), rapid eye movement behaviour disorder (RBD), nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), narcolepsy (NARCO), and insomnia (INS). Further using our prior work, the CAP phase of the sequence can be identified. The best model was obtained by long short-term memory (LSTM) along with convolutional neural network (CNN) for healthy-unhealthy, and disease classification with an accuracy of 91.45% and 90.55%, respectively. The same models gave an accuracy of 92.79% for healthy-unhealthy and 93.31% for disease classification when evaluated using dataset of only phase B, highlighting the importance of phase B for identifying sleep disorders."

# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Medical Image Analysis

## Abstract

Medical AI development faces significant challenges due to data privacy regulations and the need for large, diverse datasets. This paper presents a novel federated learning framework that enables multiple healthcare institutions to collaboratively train deep learning models for medical image analysis without sharing sensitive patient data.

## Key Contributions

1. **Privacy Framework**: Novel differential privacy mechanisms for medical federated learning
2. **Heterogeneity Handling**: Algorithms to manage data distribution differences across hospitals
3. **Clinical Validation**: Multi-site validation across 8 hospitals with 50,000+ patient studies
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Framework designed to meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements

## Methodology

Our federated learning approach incorporates:
- Secure aggregation protocols with homomorphic encryption
- Adaptive learning rates based on local data characteristics
- Byzantine fault tolerance for robust model updates
- Differential privacy with adaptive noise injection

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Achieved 94.2% accuracy (vs 91.8% for single-site training)
- **Privacy Guarantees**: ε-differential privacy with ε = 1.0
- **Communication Efficiency**: 67% reduction in communication rounds
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Successfully passed HIPAA audit at all participating sites

## Clinical Impact

The framework has been deployed across 8 major medical centers, enabling the development of more robust diagnostic models while maintaining strict privacy standards. This work has facilitated the creation of the largest federated medical imaging consortium to date.
