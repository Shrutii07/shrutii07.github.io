title: "Automated Summarization of Patient Visits into Concise Clinical Notes using LLMs (Dr. May Wang)"
description: "This project involved developing an automated long-input text summarization system designed to condense extensive clinical notes into concise, actionable summaries. The system was built to significantly enhance clinical workflow efficiency by addressing the challenge of information overload in healthcare documentation. The solution leveraged state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including BART, T5, GPT-4, BERTSUM, and Longformer, to process and synthesize long-form data. A critical component of the work was ensuring Trustworthy AI; thus, the faithfulness and factual accuracy of the generated summaries were rigorously evaluated. This validation used advanced metrics such as QuestEval, Concept-F1, and SummaC, promoting the creation of reliable, accurate, and accountable clinical documentation."
