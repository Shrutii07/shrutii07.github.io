title: "Suntracker on Rocker Bogie Mechanism"
description: "This project details the design and implementation of a self-powering, all-terrain mobile robot. The system utilizes a Rocker-Bogie mechanism for traversing diverse landscapes while maintaining platform stability via a differential gear system. To maximize operational endurance, the robot integrates a dual-axis sun-tracking mechanism that dynamically positions its solar panels, significantly increasing energy absorption efficiency. The entire robot was prototyped using CAD modeling software and features intuitive remote control capabilities through a Bluetooth joystick application on an Android phone."
